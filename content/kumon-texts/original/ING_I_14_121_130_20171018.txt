 I. 121. I am hungry because I didn't eat breakfast. Would you like some cake? Yes, please. Since it was raining, I didn't go out. I read some books and watched some videos. As it was a nice day, we went hiking. We took our lunches and ate by the river. Tom told Huck and Joe about his secret plan. Though they wanted to go home, they liked his plan and decided to stay. He's a famous pianist. He can play the piano really well, even though he can't read music. Wow, that's amazing. Would you like? Nice day. Traffic. Secret. Plan. Though. Even though. Read music.
