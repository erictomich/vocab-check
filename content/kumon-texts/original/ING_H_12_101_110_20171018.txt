What's wrong? My wallet was stolen in the subway. Did you call the police? Yes. Jane is a good artist. She won a prize in an art contest. Her painting will be displayed in the museum. The man gave the magic beans to Jack. These beans must be watered every day. Said the man. Ruth, barn, cut down, fight, call, police, contest, magic, bean.
