 I. 181. I heard that you were in Sydney last week. How was it? It was great. I went to the beach every day. Where's Dad? He's still on the bus. He said that he was sleepy. Go and wake him up. The tour guide explained to us about the British Museum. After the tour finished, he told us that we were free to look around on our own. I asked Mom who was at the door. It's your friend, Mike. He's waiting for you outside, she said. Can you come to the party next Sunday? Sure. Is Joe coming? No. I asked her if she could come, but she's busy that day. Be free to look around on our own. Agree with. Agree. Agree. Agree.
