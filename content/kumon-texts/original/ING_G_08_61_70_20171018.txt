 G61. I was in New York last week. I saw three plays there. I like them very much. I was in New York last week. I was in New York last week. I was in New York last week. Adam played soccer very hard yesterday. He was tired last night. He got up late this morning. I lost my wallet yesterday, but someone took it to the police station. You were lucky. Many people lived in the city. The people were poor, but the king was rich. There were some peanuts in the jar. Who ate them? I'm sorry. I did. Play, sick and bed. Someone lucky, poor, rich, on vacation, month, peanut, jar, a long time ago. Like, liked, lose, lost, take, took, lived, lived.
