 Story 3. Jack and the beanstalk. Jack and his mother lived on a farm. They were very poor. They sold all of their furniture to buy food. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten breakfast, said Jack. I'm sorry. We have eaten all our food, said his mother. We need money. We must sell our cow, said Jack's mother. Okay, I will sell our cow today, said Jack. He walked outside and went to the barn. He untied the cow and they walked away. Jack and the cow walked along the road. Soon he met a strange man. Look at that beautiful cow. I want to buy it, said the man. How much is it? It's five dollars, said Jack. I have no money, but how about some magic beans? Said the man. Magic beans? Okay, said Jack. The man gave the beans to Jack. These beans must be watered every day, said the man. The man walked away and Jack ran home. I didn't get any money, but now we have some magic beans, said Jack. What? No money. Go to bed, said Jack's mother angrily. Then she threw away the beans. The next morning Jack went outside. There was a huge vine. The beans grew. The vine goes to the sky, said Jack. I'm going to climb to the top. Jack went up the vine. At the top, Jack stopped climbing. He stepped onto a cloud. He was in a new world. Jack saw a really big castle. He walked to it. The door was open. Jack walked inside. Everything was huge. Jack saw a giant standing next to a goose. The giant was talking to the goose. Then the goose laid some golden eggs. I'm going to take that goose, thought Jack? Soon the giant was sleeping next to the goose. Jack took the goose. The goose made a loud noise. The giant woke up. He was angry. I will get you, said the giant. Jack ran very fast. The giant ran after him. Jack climbed down the vine. I'm going to eat you, said the giant. Jack put the goose down. Then he grabbed his axe. He cut down the vine. The giant fell to the ground. Jack and his mother were happy.
