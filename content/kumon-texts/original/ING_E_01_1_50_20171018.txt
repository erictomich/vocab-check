 Story 1. Footprints Where's my hat? It's on the desk. Where are my keys? They're on the table. Where are my shoes? I don't know. Where were your shoes yesterday? They were in my closet. These are dad's boots. They're big. They look good. Thanks, mom. Yesterday, I was in Roger's room. Ben, look! What are those? They're footprints. Are they yours? No, they're not. Let's follow the footprints. Okay, Sam. Good idea. They go downstairs. They're dirty. You're right. They're in the kitchen, too. Were you at the park yesterday? Yes, I was. Open the gate. Okay. Look! More footprints. They're on the baseball field. Now they're on the sidewalk. I'm hungry. Let's eat lunch. Okay. How about pizza? Sure. That sounds good. Oh, I don't have my wallet. I'm sorry. That's okay. I have some money in my bag. Look! The footprints are across from the theater. Were you at the bank yesterday? No. Why? The footprints are in front of the bank. They're next to the hospital, too. The footprints are in the street. They're between your house and the fence. I'm tired. Me, too. Let's go inside. Mom, I found my shoes. Where were they? They were in my room. Is that your dog? Yes, it is. Max.
