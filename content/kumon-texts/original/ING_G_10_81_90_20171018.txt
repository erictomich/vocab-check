 G81 Yesterday was my birthday. My friends came to my house. We had a good time. My father usually takes the train to work, but there was an accident today. So he drove to work. It's time for lunch. He said to his kids, they put away their toys in the box. Then they went downstairs. I went shopping with my mom. She bought me a bag. It's really nice. Please give us some silver. Silver said the man, okay, said the king. He gave the man a hundred silver coins. Go for a walk. Accident. Put away. Always. Sometimes. Get on. Silver. 100. A hundred silver coins. Story. Drive. Drove. Put. Put. Teach. Tart. Give. Give. Tell. Told.
