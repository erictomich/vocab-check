 H1. Did you enjoy the party last night? Yes, I met Mr. and Mrs. Miller there. I enjoyed talking to them. You look tired. I finished writing a report late last night. You must be sleepy. Suddenly, Gulliver felt pain. Some people were shooting arrows at him. He stopped moving his body. He said, These cups are old and expensive. They're my mothers. Her hobby is collecting antique cups. The men taught me their language. Learning their language was interesting. Soon, we could understand each other. England. Grow. Pain. Shoot. Move. Body. Hobby. Antique. Take photos. Language. Understand. Each other. Difficult. Foreign. Story. Stories.
