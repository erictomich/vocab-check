 Story 3. Fun at the zoo. Okay kids, let's go in. Where's Jill? She's sick today. Tom, do you have your ticket? Yes, it's right here. Hi everyone, I'm Melissa. This is my friend Charlie. He's a chimp. I'm older than him. But he's stronger than me. That zebra looks sick. Is he okay? He's okay. He was sick yesterday. But he's fine now. Look at those. What are they? They're pandas. They look soft. They're the most popular animals in the zoo. Cool. Neat. Elephants. What are those? Those are hippos. They're from Africa. Which are heavier? Hippos or elephants? Elephants are heavier. Wow, that's a nice camera. It's better than mine. Hi, I'm Tom. I'm Jake. I'm a photographer. I like your camera. Thank you. What's that? This is a goat. Her name is Betsy. Does she bite? No, she doesn't. Don't worry. She's nice to everyone. Look at that black snake. It's long. That white snake is longer than the black one. Is it hungry? Yes, it is. That's Chad. He's a turtle. He's the oldest animal in the zoo. How old is he? He's 90. No way. Did you have fun today? Yeah, it was great. But we're tired now. We walked a lot. Thanks for coming. See you.
