 Story 4 Tour of London I can't wait to see London. Do you know if it will rain today? It doesn't matter. We'll be in the bus. I don't know where we can catch the bus. Don't worry. I know where to catch it. Oh no! I think I forgot to bring film! There's a store across the street. You can buy some there. Okay. I'll be back in a few minutes. Hurry up so that you don't miss the bus. All right! On the bus. What's that building over there? That's the houses of Parliament. That's where laws are made. It was built in the 11th century. The British Parliament has two parts. The House of Lords and the House of Commons. What's that building next to Parliament? That's Big Ben. Big Ben is a huge clock tower. Actually, Big Ben is the bell inside the tower. When the bell was made, it was the biggest in England. The bell rings every hour. The clock tower was built almost 150 years ago. It took 13 years to build. It is 96 meters tall. There is a special light on top of the tower. When the light is on, Parliament is in session. At the museum. Where's Dad? He's still on the bus. He said he was sleepy. Go and wake him up. We're going to go into the museum soon. Dad, it's time to wake up. Oh, where are we? We're at the British Museum. Everyone, welcome to the British Museum. This museum opened in 1759. It has more than 6 million pieces of art. The museum isn't big enough to show all of them. So most of the pieces are stored under the museum. Lots of people come to the museum to see the mummies. Some mummies were once important people. And when they died, they were buried with many treasures. Many mummies were found in Egypt. Some of them were kings or queens. These statues are from ancient Greece. They're very popular. This is the end of today's tour. Please feel free to look around on your own. The museum closes at 5.30 today. Thank you. At the hotel. Did you like the museum? Yeah, I really learned a lot today. But we walked so much that my feet hurt. Where are we going tomorrow? Let's go to Buckingham Palace. That's where the queen lives. That sounds interesting.
