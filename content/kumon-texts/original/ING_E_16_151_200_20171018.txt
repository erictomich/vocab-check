 Story 4. My favorite present. Tuesday. My birthday is on Saturday. Last year, I got clothes from my parents. I have a lot of clothes. This year, I want a camera. I love photos. I have five albums. Someday, I want to be a photographer. Wednesday. Where's Julie? She's at the beach. She's swimming with her friends. When is her birthday? It's on Saturday. Does Julie like clothes? Yes, she does. She likes t-shirts better than pants. But she really likes hats. Thursday. I went to the mall. I enjoyed shopping with my friends. We ate lunch at a Chinese restaurant. I bought a present for Julie. Friday. I sent an email to my friend. I played volleyball at the park. Oh, and I bought a present for my sister. Saturday. I wrote a letter to my cousin. I made a cake for Julie. Today is her birthday. She's so excited. Sunday. Whose hats are these? Their mine. How many hats do you have? I have eleven. I like this one the best. Yesterday was my birthday. What did you get? I got a hat from mom. A hat from dad. A hat from grandma. I have something for you. Here. Open it. Wow! A camera! I love it! Thanks, Uncle Joe. You're welcome.
