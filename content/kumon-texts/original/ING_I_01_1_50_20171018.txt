 Story 1. The Wizard of Oz Dorothy lived on the prairie with her aunt and uncle. They lived far from other people. Dorothy's uncle was a farmer. She also had a small black dog. His name was Toto. He and Dorothy played together every day. Dorothy saw a big tornado coming. The winds were very strong. She grabbed Toto and ran into the house. She slammed the door. Then a strange thing happened. The house began to spin. It went up into the air. The house flew for a long time. Dorothy got tired and went to sleep. Suddenly, the house landed. And Dorothy woke up. She ran to the door and opened it. This is the most beautiful place I've ever seen. She said. Dorothy saw some small people near her house. They were wearing strange clothes. They were all afraid of Dorothy. Finally, an old woman stepped forward. Welcome to the land of the munchkins. She said. Thank you. Reply Dorothy. But who are the munchkins? Astorathy. They are. Said the woman. They're the people who live in this land. Are you a munchkin? Astorathy. No, but I'm their friend. I'm the witch of the North. Said the woman. My name is Dorothy. Said Dorothy. Where are you from, Dorothy? Said the witch. I'm from the prairie. Reply Dorothy. What's the prairie? It's where I live. Said Dorothy. I've never heard of it. Reply the witch. Can you help me get home? Ask Dorothy. I need someone who can help me. No, I can't help you. But the great wizard of Oz can. Reply the witch. Where does he live? He lives in the Emerald City. Said the witch. How do I get to the Emerald City? Astorathy. You must walk. However, it's a long and dangerous journey. Said the witch. Is there another way to get there? No. Said the witch. It's the only way that I know. Do you see that yellow brick road? That's the road which you must take. When you meet the wizard, don't be afraid of him. Tell him your story and ask him to help you. Listen carefully to him. What he says is very important. Said the witch. Thank you. Said Dorothy. You're welcome. Good luck. Said the witch. The witch turned around three times and then disappeared. After that, the munchkins disappeared into the forest. Dorothy and Toto began walking down the yellow road.
