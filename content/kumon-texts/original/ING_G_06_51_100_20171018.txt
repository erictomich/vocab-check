 Story 2. The King's New Clothes The King lived in his castle. There was a city below the castle. Many people lived there. The people were poor, but the King was rich. The King liked clothes very much. He wore new clothes every day. He changed clothes in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. His clothes were really nice. One day, two strange men came to the castle. Do you like clothes? They asked. I love clothes, said the King. We'll make special clothes for you, said the two men. The King spoke to the prince. They were very quiet. Then the King decided. He walked to the men. The parade is on Saturday. I want to wear the best clothes. We'll make beautiful clothes for you. Please give us some silver. Okay, said the King. He gave the men a hundred silver coins. We'll return on Saturday, said the men. On Thursday, the King wondered about his clothes. Please go to the men. Look at the clothes. They must be very beautiful. The King told the prince. The prince left the castle. The prince went to the men. These are the clothes. Only smart people can see our clothes. Stupid people can't see them. They're very nice, said the prince, but he didn't see anything. The men came to the castle on Saturday. Here are your clothes. Only smart people can see them, said the men. They're beautiful, said the King. Does everyone like them? Everyone nodded their heads. The King put on the clothes. He walked through the city. His friends followed him. He has no clothes, said a boy. He has no clothes, repeated his father. He's naked. Yelda woman. Everyone laughed at the King. Only smart people can see my clothes. Most people are stupid, thought the King. But the King didn't see his clothes either. He just walked and walked.
