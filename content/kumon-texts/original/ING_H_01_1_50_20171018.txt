 Story 1. Goleverse Travels My name is Lemuel Golever. I am English. I studied medicine and became a ship's doctor. In May, 1699, our ship left England. On the way to Indonesia, there was a huge storm. Our ship began to sink. I fell into the dark sea. I swam for a long time. Then I saw an island. I swam to shore and fell asleep. When I woke up, I couldn't move. There were many tiny men around me. They tied me to the ground. I tried to get up. Suddenly, I felt pain. They were shooting arrows at me. I stopped moving. The next day, they carried me to the city. The emperor untied me. Some of his men taught me their language. Learning their language was interesting for me. Soon, we could understand each other. The name of their island was Lilyput. Lilyput was at war with another island, Blevuscu. Blevuscu wanted to attack Lilyput. Please help us, said the emperor. I walked through the sea to Blevuscu. It was not far. There were many ships in the harbor. I tied ropes to them. Then I pulled the ships back to Lilyput. The emperor was happy. Get more ships, he said. He wanted to make the people of Blevuscu slaves. I didn't like his idea. I said, they should be free. You shouldn't make them your slaves. The emperor became angry. He wasn't happy to hear this. Leave my castle now, he said. I walked outside. Everyone was cheering. The war was over. The emperor of Blevuscu invited me to his island. I left Lilyput and went to Blevuscu to see him. He was very kind to me. One day, I saw a small boat in the sea. I grabbed the boat. I decided to go home. The emperor gave me a lot of food to take. He also gave me some little cows. I set out in September 1701. It was a nice day and the sea was calm. Soon, an English ship rescued me. We returned to England. I showed everyone my little cows and told them the story of my adventures.
