 Story 3. Australian Vacation It's really sunny today. Let's go to the beach. Good idea. I have to buy some sunglasses. Where's the store? It's next to the hotel. Where's my towel? It might be in my suitcase. Here you go. Thanks. Where are you going today? We're going to go to a soccer game. What time is dinner? It's at 6. Let's meet downstairs. Okay. Let's go. Where's the bus stop? We don't have to take the bus. The beach is close. Hi, I'm Gary. I'm Luke, and this is Molly. We're from America. The beach is crowded. People don't have to work today. It's a holiday. Wow. Who's that? That's my friend. She's good at surfing. She practices every day. How old is she? She's 14. Really? I'm 14 too. It's hot. Let's go swimming. Sure. What's wrong, Molly? Are you going to swim? No. I'm bad at swimming. It's okay. I'll teach you. Cool. Look at that fish. This is great. I'm really interested in the ocean. Is that a dolphin? Yes. Dolphins can swim fast. Come here. Look at the spider. That's a spider. Yuck. It's big. I'm afraid of spiders. They're scary. It's okay. This one looks nice. What time is it? It's 5.30. Do you have to go soon? Yes. We have to meet our parents at 6. Come on. Let's have dinner together. Okay. Mom, Dad, this is Gary. Hi, Gary. It's nice to meet you. You three must be hungry. Do you like steak, Gary? Yeah. Let's eat.
