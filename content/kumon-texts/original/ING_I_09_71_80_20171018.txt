 I. 71 I found your watch under the sofa. Really? Why didn't you tell me? If you had asked me, I would have told you. I was sorry to hear about your father's accident. If I had been there, I would have helped him. Thanks. He's doing better now. Where's Mr. Brown? He just laughed. If you had come earlier, you could have met him. Who ate my cake? Was it yours? I'm sorry. If I had known that, I wouldn't have eaten it. We were lucky. If we hadn't run so fast, that cat would have seen us, said the townmouse. Did you have to say the townmouse? Catch the bus. Miss the bus. Catch, caught, caught. Worn, warned, warned. Saved, saved, saved. Drowned, drowned, drowned.
