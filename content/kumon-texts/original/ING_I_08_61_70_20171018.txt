 I'm sorry, but I don't have time today. I would go if I had time. If I were you, I would find a new home. I'm going back to the country right now. I prefer my quiet and peaceful life. I would help you if I could, but I have to go back to the office for a meeting. My house is much bigger and nicer, said the town mouse. If I were rich, I could live in the town too, said the country mouse. I'm so tired. I can't go on climbing. If I could fly, I would go straight to the mountain top. Would, prefer, peaceful, life, the president, go around, go on climbing, straight.
