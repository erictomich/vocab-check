 Story 1. Thank you, coach. The dog is running. Don't eat the cookies. Don't sit on the ground. Let's play soccer. It's raining outside. Wear that raincoat. It's cold outside. They are running. It's windy outside. We are soccer players. Throw the ball. The girl is jumping. Kick the ball. I am happy. I am happy. We are thirsty. Sit on the bench. This looks good. Close the box. Open the box. Don't eat the cake.
