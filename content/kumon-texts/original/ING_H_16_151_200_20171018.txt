 Story 4. Peter Pan Have you ever flown before? Asked Peter. No, I haven't. Said Wendy. How do I do it? It's easy. I'll teach you. Said Peter. Will you teach John and Michael too? Said Wendy. Of course. First, you have to think about happy things. Then you need some magic dust. Said Peter. I have some in this bag. He sprinkled the dust on the children. Soon everyone was flying around the room. Let's go outside. Said John. Good idea. Did you reply, Michael? Wendy opened the windows and they all flew out. They saw many stars. Let's go to my home. Said Peter. Everyone followed Peter into the sky. Soon they were flying over the ocean. Peter flew down and touched a shark's tail. Said Peter. Wow. I've never touched a shark before. Said Michael. Then he touched the tail. John touched it too. How long have we been flying? I'm getting tired. Said Michael. We've been flying for three nights. I want to go home. We're lost. We have to follow Peter. Said Wendy. Here we are. Welcome to our island. Said Peter. It's beautiful. When did you come here? Asked Wendy. I came here when I was a baby. Said Peter. Cool. Look at those turtles. Said John. Peter and the children landed in a small village. Soon there were many boys around them. Peter. Who are these kids? Asked a small boy. Everyone. These are our new guests. This is Wendy, John and Michael. We build a tent for our new friends. Ordered Peter. Okay. Said the twins. Then Peter and the others went into a cave. There was a long wooden table inside. I've never seen so much food before. Said John. The twins had already finished the tent before Peter returned. He was surprised. This is a great tent. Good job. He said. Thanks. Said the twins. The other boys came to look at the tent. Come into our tent. I'll tell everyone a story. Said Wendy. The excited boys followed Wendy, John and Michael into the tent. It was crowded inside. Wendy told a story. Everyone fell asleep and had wonderful dreams.
