 I 111 As they sat in front of the fire, they thought about their families. Tom thought about Aunt Polly. Tom had lived with Aunt Polly since his mom died. It was already eight o'clock. I couldn't wait any longer, but she came in as I started to leave. While the other two were still in the same place, I was still in the same place. I was still in the same place. I was still in the same place. While the other two were sleeping, Tom left the camp and swam across the river. When he finally got to his house, he peeked in through the window. I go for a walk in the park every morning. While walking, I listen to my CD player. Breakfast tastes better after walking. He's out, but he'll be back in ten minutes. You can wait here until he comes back. In front of any longer while across the river television go for a walk and be back in ten minutes. Shut, shut, shut. Peek, peaked, peaked.
