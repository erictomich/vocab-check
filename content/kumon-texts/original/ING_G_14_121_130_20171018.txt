 G. 121 What are you watching? I am watching a baseball game. It's really exciting! What are you doing? I am writing a letter to grandma. Please say hello for me. There was the rabbit. He was running through a hall. Alice chased the rabbit. Can you turn off the TV please? I am not watching it now. All right. Are they playing video games? No, they're studying. They have a test tomorrow. Exciting! Say hello for. Test. Fly. Flu. Change. Changing.
