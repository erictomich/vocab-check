 Story 1. The Fox and the Crow Mr. Fox has a problem. He is very hungry, but he doesn't have any food. There is no food in the fridge. There is no food in the cupboard. He says to himself. Mr. Fox opens the door and goes outside. It is warm and sunny. He looks around. There are some rabbits. They are playing by the river. He walks towards them. Excuse me. Do you have any food? Ask Mr. Fox. No, we don't. Says the big rabbit. Do you want to play with us? No, I want to eat. Says Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox leaves the rabbits. He goes over the bridge. He walks along the road. The trees are really tall. He is still very hungry, and his stomach is noisy. Mr. Fox. Near Mr. Fox, Ms. Crow is flying in the sky. She is hungry. It is time for breakfast. She lands in a big tree. She sees some mice. They are walking on the grass. The mice are going on a picnic. They have a lot of food. One mouse drops some cheese, but he doesn't notice it. The mice don't stop. Ms. Crow sees the cheese. She flies down and takes the cheese. Then she flies up to the tree again. This cheese smells very tasty, but I can't eat it. It's too big. Thanks, Ms. Crow. Mr. Fox sees Ms. Crow. He stops under the tree. May I have your cheese? He says. Ms. Crow shakes her head. Some of her black feathers fall. Mr. Fox has an idea. Ms. Crow, you are so pretty. And your voice is so beautiful. Please sing for me. Ms. Crow is very proud. She agrees with Mr. Fox. Ms. Crow opens her mouth. The cheese falls and Mr. Fox's mouth. Thank you, Ms. Crow. I'm not hungry now. Ms. Crow cries.
