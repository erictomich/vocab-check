 Story 3. Alice in Wonderland Alice sat next to the river. She was bored. Her sister was next to her. Her sister was reading a book. Then a white rabbit ran near them. The rabbit had a big watch. Oh, I'm late. Said the rabbit. Then he jumped into a hole. Alice ran to the hole. She was very curious. She jumped into the hole too. She went down, down, down. The hole was deep. Alice fell far. Then she landed on some leaves. She was okay. Alice looked around. There was the rabbit. He was running through a hall. Alice chased the rabbit. The rabbit turned right. Alice followed him. She was in a long hall. Where is the rabbit? Alice said to herself. There were many doors. All the doors were locked. Alice saw a small table. There was a gold key on the table. Then Alice found a small door. It was behind a curtain. She used the key and opened the door. She saw a colorful garden. There were many flowers and trees. The door is too small. I'm too big. I can't fit. Said Alice, she closed the door. I want to be small. Said Alice, she saw a small bottle next to the door. Drink me. Said the bottle. Alice drank it. Then she became smaller. Alice ran to the door. She couldn't open it. The key was on the table. Then she saw a box. There was a cake inside. Eat me. Said the cake. Alice ate it. Suddenly Alice grew. She was three meters tall. The door was too small again. This made her cry and cry. Her tears made a pond. Then Alice became smaller again. Alice swam in the pond. Many other animals were swimming too. The animals followed Alice. They swam to shore. All the animals were safe. Alice didn't see the rabbit.
